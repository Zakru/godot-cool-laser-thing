# Godot Cool Laser Thing

[The cool laser thing I made.](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/ii9h1r/i_have_found_my_love_for_particles_and_lasers/)

To try it out, copy the `laser` directory into your project's root (otherwise
you'll have to reassign all the assets to the scene). I have no idea if it works
properly lol, I have never put up something like this before.

Camera shake is outside the scope of this repo, since it's quite simple to
implement. Add it into the `fire` function of `laser.gd` if you want.
